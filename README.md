## project 1.1 - Social Card

We've created a mock social network feed with some test post data.
Here's what you should do:

- fork this repo on Github
- clone your forked repo to your local machine
- in the social-card directory, run `yarn && yarn start`
- go into ./src/Card.js
- style the card component with styled-components and CSS. You might find it valuable to look at model feed UIs for design inspiration (https://www.styled-components.com/)
- implement card expansion using React state (https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
